  console.log("Connected to the portable MongoDB database.");

  // Define a schema and model

    message: String
  });

  const Message = mongoose.model("Message", messageSchema);

  // Insert a document with the message: "allahu akbar"
  const newMessage = new Message({ message: "Hello World" });
  await newMessage.save();

  console.log("Message inserted:", newMessage);
